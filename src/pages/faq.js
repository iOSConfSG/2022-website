    question: "What is the focus of iOS Conf SG - 2022?",
    answer: "SwiftUI has matured over the last few years. iOS 15 SDK introduces dozens of new APIs.<br/><br/>We will have some talks related to practical applications of these technologies.<br/><br/>However, the main focus of the conference is still to provide tools and techniques to iOS developers that they can use to build mobile applications with the highest quality.<br/><br/>We try not to keep too many beginner talks and emphasise more on knowledge sharing based on the expertise of the speakers.",

    id: 5,
    question: "What is the requirement for the room setup?",
    answer: "<strong>Turn your webcam on</strong><br/>We encourage all participants to turn-on their webcams to get the maximum value out of the conference. Keeping the energy high in a virtual event is extremely important. We will have different games throughout the conference.<br/><br/>By turning on your webcam, you let other participants feed on your energy and vice versa. We promise it will be a mad fun week that you will remember for a long time.<br/><br/><strong>Keep the house neat and clean</strong><br/>Make sure the environment is friendly for other participants who will get to see your live feed. We encourage keeping the background clean.<br/><br/>You may use zoom background. But do not use a video background. We will provide an official iOS Conf SG zoom background that you may consider to use.",
  },

    id: 6,
    question:
      "Will there be breaks for snacks/food?",
    answer:
      "As we are only going to have a maximum of 5 hours per day, we will have fewer breaks compared to an actual conference.<br/><br/>e suggest you prepare your food before the event starts or take help of others to arrange your food. We will continue to have social interactions and activities during the breaks that you may not want to miss.<br/><br/>You may consider having cut-fruits, water, smoothies or juices to keep you refilled.<br/><br/>All sessions will start and end on time. So if you need to leave, you will have to miss that part of the event.<br/><br/>Having said that - we would have a few short breaks at regular intervals. ",

    id: 7,
    question: "Can I invite a friend to attend the event with me?",

We will only allow one connection per registration.<br/><br/>If you are staying with a friend or your partner wants to attend the event with no additional cost for maximum up to 2 participants, including the main participant.<br/><br/>Again this is out of a good-will, please do not try to bend the rule. If the moderators notice this, we will remove you from the zoom session.",

    id: 8,
