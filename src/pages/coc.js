              iOS Conf SG prides itself on being an open, respectful, and
              inclusive community. That means jerky behavior isn’t allowed at
              any iOS Conf SG events (including after-parties). Because we know
              that it’s not obvious to everyone, here’s a reminder of the things
              we don’t allow: jokes or offensive comments about
              sex/sexuality/race/religion/nationality/body size, showing porn in
              public, touching people uninvited, or continuing to interact with
              someone after they’ve asked you to stop. Continuous jerky behavior
              may result in getting expelled from the conference.
            </p>
            <p>
              If someone is bothering you, please tell iOS Conf SG Organizers
              immediately and they will take care of it. We want to maintain iOS
              Conf SG’s awesomeness.
            </p>
